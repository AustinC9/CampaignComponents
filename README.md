Appa is likely the most recognizable creature within the Avatar franchise, and he’s also the cutest. Yet, despite his cuddly nature, Appa can be tough as nails when he needs to be. He has defeated several opponents like Long Feng, Tai Lee, and Mai. Appa can also understand humans, giving him a high amount of intelligence for a flying chauffer.

Appa is strictly a vegetarian. His teeth are flat, ideal for eating plants and fruits. Sky Bison are known to graze on the top of trees, much like other animals who graze in the fields. Appa however, preferred hay over plants. But he’s known to go toe-to-toe with Momo over a piece of fruit when the mood suited him.
